                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something that I learned from this article is how there are various components
                                that go into a website design. In fact, there are some representations where the design 
                            is also animated. I also thought it was cool that in some of the designs, there were some elements that changed with certain actions, such as color and layout.  </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favourite part of this article was the various design layouts. For example, with each particular design, there would be a unique perk such as its background layout. 
                                Moreover, there were designs that showed how the layout changed with certain actions, and I thought it was pretty cool to see how that change 
                                worked with the overall design. I think each of these designs made the user experience much more interactive as a whole. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> One of my favourite inspirations was the design with "Transitions Experiments". I think this design just showed how fluid 
                                certain transitions were and how they all fit perfectly within the background in action. Moreover, I really liked the "Welcome Scree" that had an animation and then 
                            suddenly transitioned into a login page. The transition was also fluid.    </p>

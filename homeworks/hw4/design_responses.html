							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned from this article is that color contrast is very important to keep in mind. There are many individuals
								who suffer from color impairment, so it is vital to keep in mind how one's website fares with color contrast and as a whole 
								accessibility. There are many tools to use in order to rate certain contrasts, such as trello and color palette.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was how to work with accessibilty improvement. So, for example, with tools like color palette, it's important 
								to maintain an aspect ratio of 5.4:1 and we can identify an optimal rating of AA. Another cool attribute is that we can alter the hue and saturation of the contrast to maintain the rating.  </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>  "Accounting for accessibility early on in a product’s life cycle is best—it reduces the time and money you’ll spend to make your products accessible retroactively."</p>
						</li>

							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something I learned from this article is that depending on the purpose of a design and readability, 
								we can derive certain scaling ratios for our font sizes. We can use tools such as modulear scale 
								to fit partiucalr font size ratios. I also learned that font size shoudld be influenced on an audience as well, 
								where more older individuals would need better color contrast and larger letters for better readability. 
							 </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favourite part about this article is regarding how typography has various elements that go hand-in-hand. ]
								For example, the font we choose and the overall design of the page needs to align with the purpose of the site. 
							Moreover, font-size should also consider user audience, where based on age, some font sizes would be more ideal. </p>

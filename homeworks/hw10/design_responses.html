							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think this article really was interesting when considering psychology and how it influences our decisions in making a site. I definetly now agree that 
								there are various factors based on our senses and perception that need to be considered when grabbing a user's attention. For example, we wouldn't want so many things going on within a site, 
							as it can lead to change blindness or a lack of perception towards a particular object. Before this article, I wasn't aware of the importance of psychology, but I am more considerate of the various factors that come into play psychologically when 
						creating a site.  </p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article and why?</p>
							<p> 9 because at the same time, I didn't realize the importance of considering psychology in terms of design. Also, 
								I did learn about some new psychological terms and how they are applied in the scope of our perception and realization. </p>

                Hello! My name is Abtin, and I am a freshman studying Computer Science.
                I am passionate about technology, programming languages, and algorithm design.

                <li>
                    <p>Something I learned from this artcile was that there is always a reason for how a site is formatted.
                        It's important to stay curious why certain design features were implemented, and also why some were discarded/hidden. </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                   <p> My favourite part about this article was how the author explained here thinking 
                    when analayzing certain sites, such as twitter. She reasoned how unique it was that the users
                    identification was bold, while some of the other details like follower count were not as established. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>"Next time youâ€™re sitting in a Lyft or waiting on a friend, open up an app and think through the reasons why the designers chose to design it that way."</p>
                    

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I would say 8.

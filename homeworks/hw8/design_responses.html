						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Something I learned from this article is that there is a big difference between "dark design" and "bad design." A big differnece is that 
							dark design is a design in which the user is being forced or made to do something that they don't really want to or that they don't realize 
							doing. It should also be noted that dark design should be avoided, as "transparency" with a user is more important and valuable rather than tricking 
						the user into doing something that they don't want to do. 						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was about the various types of dark design. There was various discussions on continutity, which is 
							a type of design that forces users to continue through a payyment method or subscription. The article also talked about another design called 
							friend spam, where LinkedIn was actually charged for continuous spam emails/notifications for connections.
